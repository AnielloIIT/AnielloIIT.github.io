            Hello! My name is Aniello Scartozzi and this is my website. I was
            born in Rochester Hills Michigan and have a unique passion for
            technology. I built this website to showcase my passion for
            technology while also providing a medium for anyone to see my work
            or find my contacts. I am interested in all fields of information
            technology but I am specificity interested in the internet of
            things, full stack development, hardware, white hat testing, front
            and back end development. Below you can find more specifics about
            myself.

        <div class="job job-1">
          <h3>Web Development</h3>
          <h6>HTML, CSS, Javascript</h6>
          <p>
            I have been creating websites for about 6 years now. I keep my
            websites optimized and modern using up to date web markup. My
            websites are build mobile first so they will look good across a wide
            array of devices. This ensures that my sites can be seen by
            everyone.
          </p>

        <div class="job job-2">
          <h3>Backend Development</h3>
          <h6>Shell Scripting, Linux, Databases</h6>
          <p>
            My passion also lies with back end development. This involves
            installing operating systems on machines to build a network
            backends. This includes maintaining and securing networks. I can use
            Linux to do anything from serving web pages to setting up email
            servers.

        <div class="job job-3">
          <h3>White Hat Tester</h3>
          <h6>Ethical Hacking</h6>
          <p>
            I also indulge in white hat testing which is a fancy term for an
            ethical hacker. I stay up on this in order to maintain security for
            my websites, programs and networks. The only way to have a good
            defense is by knowing the game of the offense.
